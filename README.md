# Harnessing RAG-Based LLMs in Streamlit: Monetizing a Smart Q&A App on Vipas.AI

## Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming AI applications, but they often rely on **static training data**, making it difficult to provide **real-time, domain-specific answers**. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** enhances LLMs by integrating **real-time document retrieval**, allowing AI to deliver **context-aware, up-to-date responses**.

This guide walks you through **building, deploying, and monetizing** a **RAG-powered Q&A application** using **Streamlit** and **Vipas.AI**. With **VipasSDK**, you can seamlessly integrate **real-time LLM-powered responses** into your app while monetizing every interaction.

## Key Features
✅ **AI-Powered Smart Q&A** – Enhances LLMs with real-time document retrieval  
✅ **Seamless Deployment** – Hosted on Vipas.AI for instant accessibility  
✅ **Monetization-Ready** – Earn revenue for every API call  
✅ **Scalable & Secure** – Supports large-scale AI deployments with ease  
✅ **Streamlit Integration** – Build a user-friendly interactive interface  

## How It Works
This project integrates **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to **extract, index, and retrieve knowledge from uploaded documents** before generating AI-powered responses. The trained model is deployed as a live AI service on **Vipas.AI**.

### Technical Breakdown:
1. **Extracting text** from PDFs, DOCX, and Excel files  
2. **Generating vector embeddings** using **Sentence Transformers**  
3. **Storing & retrieving data** via **FAISS indexing**  
4. **Using VipasSDK** for **LLM-powered responses**  
5. **Deploying a Streamlit app** on **Vipas.AI**
